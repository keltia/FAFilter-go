# README.md

This is the Go port of the FAFilter utility written in C#/WFC by J. Van Meenen for ECTL.
All errors are mine, not Jan's.

## Goal

To have a Go port that is more documented and readable and could serve as a foundation for
future Go developments.

## Usage

Usage is almost verbatim from the C# version except for `-x` instead of `-h` (standard UNIX usage).
Time format is probably slightly different as well.

## Author

The main author is Ollivier Robert <ollivier.robert@eurocontrol.int>
